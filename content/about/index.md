I began my professional journey in Biomedical Engineering, where I learned to think of technology in terms of human outcomes.  I have carried this mindset into my work in IT Risk Assurance, where I have developed a strong foundation in risk management, governance and cybersecurity across highly regulated sectors such as banking and financial services. Further, my work has exposed me to enterprise cloud environments, where I have supported critical data migration initiatives and, along the way, deepened my understanding of how data flows across distributed systems, and how to architect cloud environments that uphold core security principles.

To support this journey, I am currently enhancing my technical proficiency by building hands-on skills in designing and securing cloud environments. I am also deliberately pursuing industry-recognized certifications across leading cloud platforms to validate my skills and experience.
